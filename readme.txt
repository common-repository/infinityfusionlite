A Complete Admin UI overhaul, giving you multiple responsive and retina ready skins for your Wordpress Dashboard.

== Description ==
<p>Revolutionise the way that you use Wordpress in your day-to-day life. It is sad how many 'premium' Wordpress themes completely disregard the admin user experience. As the long standing admin UI becomes &#39;stale&#39;, many secretly long for a dramatic redesign, and that redesighn has finally arrived. InfinityFusion is a fully responsive and retina display ready (and even higher!) set of admin themes to accompany your front end Wordpress theme, giving your users or clients a completely rounded and premium experience: This is a great way to impress all who view your work and make you and your website stand out from the crowd.</p>
